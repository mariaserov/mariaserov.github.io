**üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Currently working on**: Leveraging Geometric Deep Learning to develop explainable AI tools helping us understand molecular mechanisms of diseases with major unadressed need
## SUMMARY

## PROJECTS <br>
<br>

üß¨ **Deep Learning to predict 3D structure of RNA (ongoing)** <br>
- Developing novel architectures by iterating on state-of-the-art methods to predict 3D structure of RNA molecules from their sequence
- Incorporating physio-chemical information and learnt evolutionary patterns into model architecture to improve prediction performance 


üîç **Unsupervised ML & Explainable AI to uncover complex disease mechanisms** <br>
- Conducted an extensive collaborative  project, pioneering an Unsupervised Machine Learning approach to uncover molecular signatures of complex diseases and identify novel biomarkers for diagnostics and treatment. 
- Conceptualised research plan and analytical pipeline, provided continuous technical and scientific guidance to the team 
- Employed unsupervised ML (Gaussian Mixture Models within consensus clustering framework) to identify distinct molecular subtypes within hypertension cohort significantly associated with six cardiobascular outcomes
- Comprehensively characterised the molecular signature of high-risk subtype using state-of-the-art computational and explainable AI methods (including Graph Neural Networks & Stability Selection LASSO), identifying novel biomarkers for diagnostic and pharmaceutical applications


ü§ñ **Computer Vision for Breast Cancer Diagnosis from Histopathology Images** <br> 
- Applied state-of-the-art CNN architectures ([ConvNeXT-V2(https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00808)], [DenseNET-121](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993)) to breast cancer diagnosis prediction task, including malignancy and tumour subtypes, and comparing performance with benchmark [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)
- Optimised model pipeline to achieve 95% accuracy for breast cancer prediction
- Focused on clinical relevance by using explainable AI tools to extract the most predictive features - both highlighting key features for diagnosis, and potentially identifying novel features for oncological research. 


üó∫Ô∏è **Bayesian Spatio-Temporal Modelling of Crime Against Women in India** <br>
- Developed hierarchical Bayesian models of spatio-temporal trends of crime, employing Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation for computational modelling. 
- Identified anomalous spatio-temporal crime patterns to inform policy and district-level interventions.
